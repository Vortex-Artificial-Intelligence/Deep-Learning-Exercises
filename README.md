# Deep-Learning-Exercises

This repository contains some simple exercises on deep learning and deep neural networks.

1. **Simple Classification**: A simple exercise on neural network for classification questions. The task is to classify 2-dimensional data using a neural network model and plot the decision boundary.

2. **Simple Regression**: A simple exercise on neural network for regression questions. The task is to fit a 1-dimensional data using a neural network model and plot the fitting curve.
